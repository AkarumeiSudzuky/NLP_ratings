# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Yelp reviews and classify them based on the star ratings. The classification process leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to build predictive models that can distinguish between positive and negative reviews. The dataset used contains information on Yelp reviews, including text, star ratings, and various feedback categories like "cool," "useful," and "funny."
